# This is a command-line executable that will return all DNS records made by a
# customer when provided his/her name. While it interfaces with the work in 
# the DNSLogging project, I've imported all code directly into this file, 
# so that it's a single package. System dependencies being resolved, just throw
# it into your path and run.
